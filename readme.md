This is my own version of [Hacker News website](https://news.ycombinator.com), playing around with _vanilla javascript_ only to build the solution. The data is provided by an open HN api - https://github.com/HackerNews/API

### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
